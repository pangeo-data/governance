## The Project

The Pangeo Project (The Project) is an open source software project. The goal 
of The Project is to develop open source software and related technology for the 
analysis of large scientific datasets. The Project endeavors to extend the 
broader scientific software ecosystem.  The Software developed by The Project is
released under the BSD (or similar) open source license, developed openly and 
hosted in public GitHub repositories under the Pangeo-data GitHub organization.
Examples of Project Software include the tools and configurations related to the
deployment of computational infrastructure. The Services run by The Project
consist of public websites and web-services that are hosted under the pangeo.io
or pangeo-data.org domains. Examples of Project Services include the Pangeo
website (https://pangeo.io), Pangeo-JupyterHub
deployments (https://pangeo.pydata.org and https://pangeo.informaticslab.co.uk),
and the Pangeo-Binder (https://binder.pangeo.io).

The Project is developed by a team of distributed developers, called
Contributors. Contributors are individuals who have contributed to code, code
reviews, documentation, design, and infrastructure, or to mailing lists, chats,
community help and community building, education and outreach, or other work in
relation to one or more Project repositories. Anyone can be a Contributor.
Contributors can be affiliated with any legal entity or none. Contributors
participate in The Project by submitting, reviewing and discussing GitHub Pull
Requests and Issues and participating in open and public Project discussions on
GitHub, Gitter chat rooms and mailing lists. The foundation of Project
participation is openness and transparency.

Here is a list of the current Contributors to the main Pangeo repository:

https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo/graphs/contributors

There are also many other Contributors listed in the logs of other repositories
of the Pangeo Project.

The collection of all Contributors to The Project and stakeholders in The
Project, including Users and Funders, is called The Community.  Contributors
work on behalf of and are responsible to the larger Project Community and we
strive to keep the barrier between Contributors and Users as low as possible.


## Governance

### The Steering Council

The Project will have a Steering Council that consists of Project Contributors
nominated as expalined below. The Steering Council should be composed of
a diverse array of backgrounds, viewpoints and talents. The overall role of the
Council is to ensure, through taking input from the Community, the long-term
well-being of The Project, both technically and as a community. As The Project
draws its strength from representing the Community, it strives to avoid
fragmentation of the Community into separate projects, if possible.
The Steering Council will maintain a minimum of three members.

During the everyday Project activities, Council Members participate in all
discussions, code review and other Project activities as peers with all other
Contributors and the Community. In these everyday activities, Council Members do
not have any special power or privilege through their membership on the Council.
However, it is expected that because of the quality and quantity of their
contributions and their expert knowledge of The Project Software and Services
that Council Members will provide useful guidance, both technical and in terms
of Project direction, to potentially less experienced Contributors.

The Steering Council and its Members play a special role in certain situations.
In particular, the Council may:

* Make decisions about the overall scope, vision and direction of The Project.
* Make decisions about strategic collaborations with other organizations or
  individuals.
* Make decisions about specific technical issues, features, bugs and pull
  requests. They are the primary mechanism of guiding the code review process and
  merging pull requests.
* Make decisions about the Services that are run by The Project and manage those
  Services for the benefit of The Project and Community.
* Make decisions when regular Community discussion doesn’t produce consensus on
  an issue in a reasonable time frame.

Outcomes and decisions should be clearly communicated to the Community. This can
take three different forms:

* New challenges for Pangeo will be detailed as a GitHub issue for the Community
  to discuss.
* Resolved technical deadlocks will result in an explanation on the relevant
  issue and/or closure of the relevant pull request.
* Other decisions will be detailed as a narrative blog post.

#### Council Membership

To become eligible for being a Steering Council Member an individual must be a
Project Contributor who has produced contributions that are substantial in
quality and quantity, and sustained over at least six months.
After confirming the potential Council Member is interested and willing to serve
in that capacity, Members are nominated by Community Contributors and voted upon
by the existing Council via majority vote.

When considering potential Members, the Council will look at candidates with a
comprehensive view of their contributions. This will include but is not limited
to code, code review, infrastructure work, mailing list and chat participation,
community help/building, education and outreach, design work, etc. We are
deliberately not setting arbitrary quantitative metrics (like “100 commits in
this repo”) to avoid encouraging behavior that plays to the metrics rather than
The Project’s overall well-being. We want to encourage a diverse array of
backgrounds, viewpoints and talents in our team, which is why we explicitly do
not define code as the sole metric on which Council Membership will be evaluated.

There are two mechanisms by which a Council Member may exit the Steering
Council:

1. Council Members may resign their posting at any time during their tenure on
   the Steering Council. In order to maintain an active, energetic, and healthy
   council, Council Members will self-facilitate membership check-ins every 6
   months to confirm that each member intends on continue their service on the
   Council.
2. A majority of the existing Council votes to remove a Member.

If a Council Member becomes inactive in The Project for a period of one year,
they will be considered for removal from the Council. Before removal, an
inactive Member will be approached by the a Council Member to see if they plan
on returning to active participation. If not they will be removed immediately
upon a Council vote. If they plan on returning to active participation soon,
they will be given a grace period of one year. If they don’t return to active
participation within that time period they will be removed by vote of the
Council without further grace period.

All former Council Members can be considered for Membership again at any time
in the future, like any other Project Contributor. Retired Council Members
will be listed on the Project website, acknowledging the period during which
they were active in the Council.

#### Expectations for Council Members

Steering council members are expected to commit to the following activities:
- Attend a one-hour steering council meeting every quarter.
- Respond in a timely manner to steering-council-related correspondence.
- Act as an ambassador for the project in professional contexts.
- Contribute to fulfilling the Project's obligations to its Fiscal Sponsor.

#### Conflict of Interest

It is expected that Council Members will be employed at a wide range of
companies, universities and non-profit organizations. Because of this, it is
possible that Members will have conflict of interests. Such conflict of
interests include, but are not limited to:

* Financial interests, such as investments, employment, or contracting work,
  outside of The Project that may influence their work on The Project.
* Access to proprietary information of their employer that could potentially
  leak into their work with The Project.
* An issue where the person privately gains an advantage from The Project
  resources, but The Project has no gain or suffers a disadvantage.

All Members of the Council shall disclose to the rest of the Council any
conflict of interest they may have. Members with a conflict of interest in a
particular issue may participate in Council discussions on that issue, but must
recuse themselves from voting on the issue.

## Fiscal Sponsor, Project Funds, and Project Sponsors

The Project is associated with a Fiscal Sponsor. The Fiscal Sponsor maintains
all legal and fiduciary responsibility for the Project and its employees.
The current Fiscal Sponsor of the project is NumFOCUS Inc.
The Steering Council will delegate one member to be the official liaison with
the Fiscal Sponsor.

The Fiscal Sponsor provides banking services to the Project and maintains a
dedicated bank account for the Project (Project Funds). The Project may obtain
funds from donations, grants, fees, and services. Any use of Project Funds must
be approved by a majority vote of the Steering Council.

Individuals or institutions who make donations to the project (cash or in-kind)
will be acknowledged as official Project Sponsors.
The Steering Council may choose to define specific sponsorship tiers and mechanisms of
acknowledgement of Project Sponsors via a Sponsorship Policy.
The Sponsorship Policy is not considered part of this governance document.

The Steering Council is the primary leadership for The Project. 
No outside sponsor, institution, individual or legal entity has the ability to own,
control, usurp or influence The Project other than by participating in the Project
as Contributors and Council Members.

## Changing the Governance Documents

Changes to the governance documents are submitted via a GitHub pull request to
The Project's governance documents GitHub repository at
https://github.com/pangeo-data/governance. The pull request is then refined in
response to public comment and review, with the goal being consensus in the
community. The period for open comment will last in proportional to the
complexity of the changes; major changes will be open for comment for no less
than two weeks. After this open period, a Steering Council Member proposes to
the Steering Council that the changes be ratified and the pull request merged
(accepting the proposed changes) or proposes that the pull request be closed
without merging (rejecting the proposed changes). The Member should state the
final commit hash in the pull request being proposed for acceptance or rejection
and briefly summarize the pull request. A minimum of 80% of the Steering Council
must vote and at least 2/3 of the votes must be positive to carry out the
proposed action (fractions of a vote rounded up to the nearest integer).
